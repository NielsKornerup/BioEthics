	<center> <h1> Future Implications </h1> </center>
	<p> Eugenics has many positive future implications. If properly implicated, it could result in the extinction of human disease via superior immune systems. We would also be able to select against genetic disorders, removing them from the gene pool entirely. A society after the implementation of eugenics would be more productive. The field of science would advance more quickly due to more intelligent scientists, which in turn would lead to more useful technologies by engineers. In addition, improved physical fitness would make the manual laborer able to do more work per unit time. Selective breeding for more efficient metabolisms could reduce the global demand for food, allowing the earth to sustain an ever increasing human population. Implementing eugenics would also cause the population to dip in the short term, further decreasing our strain on our environment. While all of these positives could result from eugenics, there could also be some negative implications. If genetic engineering is only implemented on those who can afford it, or if eugenics excludes the members of the population who aren’t as fit, then it can result in a more polarized society between the biologically “superior” aristocracy and the rest of society. There is also the dilemma of getting to the point where genetic engineering becomes a viable ption for even the richer members of society. To get to that point a great deal of testing needs to be done on modifying real human embryos, which can possibly result in their death. Upon initiating a research project scientists must first consider all of the ethical issues surrounding the topic. They must analyze the net benefit of the research venture, always questioning “Do the ends justify the means?” If there is indeed benefits that to the rational mind would consider to exceed the ethical concerns, then the research project should continue. The value of a human life is something very much to consider, and undergoing a project should require consent of those involved. Of course, it is impossible to get the consent of a fetus, so in this case, a researcher should get support from both parental parties.
