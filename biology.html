	<center> <h1> Biological Background </h1> </center>
	<p> In AP Biology, we learned that evolution is change over time. Micro evolution, the change in allele frequencies within a population, can result from natural selection. In the state of nature, where the strong survive and the weak die off, natural selection results in an overall improvement of the gene pool. However, when individuals that would not have survived are allowed to, their “less fit” genes become incorporated into the gene pool. This can be shown by the prevalence of traits such as poor vision in humans. According to the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, mankind is currently in a state where it is not evolving. Our population size is large (more than 7 billion), we are not under the whim of natural selection, and human sexual selection has next to nothing to do with relative fitness. The only other factor that can cause evolution is mutations. There are many more ways that a mutation can be harmful than beneficial. Following the statistical idea behind the second law of thermodynamics, it is easier for things to be disordered than ordered, and thus it is more likely that a mutation will deform a protein, decreasing its function than it would improve it. Despite this, when selected for, humans are able to promote certain traits in lifeforms that we have domesticated. We have turned the grain maize into corn, and evolved certain animals to have more muscles and fat. Ignoring ethical issues, if we were to apply this to humans, we could select for physical fitness, mental abilities, or almost anything we wanted. Another pair of options that are becoming available for us are genetic testing and genetic engineering. Genetic testing allows us to find out a baby’s genes before it is born, and can currently be used to test for genetic disorders. It should be possible to use genetic testing to find out other traits, such as athleticism; however, this raises an ethical dilemma if abortion is on the table of options. Another futuristic development is genetic engineering, where we directly manipulate genes in a baby before it is born. This technique has been implemented in the Belgian blue cow, replacing a protein that stops muscle growth with an inactive form, and thus resulting in cows with 20% more muscle mass. Implementing this on babies could allow us to create “designer babies” that have “superior” genetic makeup.
