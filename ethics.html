	<center> <h1> Ethical Issue </h1> </center>
	<p> The implementation of Eugenics within humans has been among the most polemical topics within the 21st century. To view the issue lucidly and in its entirety, is first imperative to distinguish between the various form of Eugenics, and how these have been applied in past and contemporary society. Eugenics is the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. This is done on the population level, by selectively breeding traits of large amounts of people, or on the individual level by genetic engineering. An example of artificial selection (a process where humans select for traits in another species) on the population level would be the development of disease-resistant okra (also known as Lady’s Fingers). Okra was prone to yellow vein mosaic disease, where fruit produced had diminished size. A new variety was thus produce by hybridizing this plant with hibiscus which gave off normal sized fruit. Selectively breeding fruits and vegetables is often done to increase growth and quality. An instance of genetic engineering would be parent improving the potential of their offspring by genetically modifying the fetus using current genetic technologies and knowledge. This leaves an “improved” species, but there are ethics surrounding the violated rights of the fetus, who might disagree with the modifications being done on it when it is older.

The criticism towards application of eugenics is directed against both the population and the individual scale. On the population scale, people argue that the presence of force or compulsion is most often related in creating an improved population, initiating change within a group without  their say say, which people say tyrannical. A typical example that serves this argument is the holocaust. Mass spread genocide to develop a “purer” population was done by complete force. People also bring up the point that the “more adapted” part of society is vastly outnumbered by the lesser adapted- We see a lot less becoming doctors, lawyers, etc. than those becoming other, arguably less skilled professions. A large scale implementation of Eugenics would require the use of force, which is unethical. A larger population requires more oppressive force to make change within a population. On the individual model, which is up to the discretion of the parents without the say of some outside force, criticism is also present. There is the imposition of arbitrary standards of perfection. Some would question what it means to be “improved?”  People argue it’s an ambiguous term, and have differing opinions on what standards are considered valuable and thus should be implemented within people. This disparity in the notion of perfection can result in censuring of not only select parents initiating “improvements” but by the offspring once developed into a fully maturated adult. Another dilemma with individual scale eugenics is that inequities that might arise from allowing the practice of eugenic choice. Those who choose to invest into genetic engineering will have more productive offspring, who in turn will be able to accumulate more wealth. This could result in a eugenic aristocracy, increasing the disparity between the eugenic rich and the poor masses. This brings up the notion if it is ethical for humans to be put on completely different playing fields in terms of biological makeup- fitness, intelligence, etc. because of the uneven distribution of wealth. The wealthier an individual is, the more “improved” he can make his offspring, which seems very unethical to some. There is not much novel to this notion of wealth equating to an improved being, but this idea is manifested in it’s rawest form in genetic engineering.

Despite the numerous repercussions of implementing eugenics in humans, people argue there are just as many, if not more, benefits of doing so. Many associate Eugenics, on anything or anyone, a process of nature. People argue that the process of Eugenics is simply an extension of Natural Selection. Natural selection hasn’t done it’s job to “weed out” the genetically weak humans, and Eugenics can simply help the natural world do it’s job. The frequency of beneficial traits will increase in a population by the use of Eugenics, leading to an “improved society,” just like in natural selection. If Eugenics is ethically wrong, then is natural selection just as ethically wrong? People also argue eugenics is very much already present in our society in the form of artificial selection, illustrating its lack of harm-- The breeding of plants and animals to exhibit desired traits. People draw parallels between the natural processes and artificial processes of our world, and it is by comparison of these together they determine the ethicality of Eugenics. Taking a kantian standpoint, some argue that It is unethical to bring individuals into this world who will suffer due to an avoidable cause. If you could create the most happiness of the individual (arguably) by fettering the diseases in one’s life, why would you not do so and create unnecessary suffering for the person? This stance also agrees with utilitarian ethics. It is the greatest good for the greatest number of people to eradicate diseases, as generations free of defections will thank their ancestors who underwent genetic engineering. There is a method to undergo eugenic trimming of a population that limits the unethical concerns: Harvard professor of psychology offers a caste system in which the literate people are carefully separated from the illiterates, this provides many benefits that can “save civilization.” While the division of intelligence is better developed into the entire society, the intellectuals will take all of the intellectually demanding jobs such the position of an MD and the lesser minds would take on jobs such as farming. This social stratification would allow for efficient use of society’s capacity for doing work, an efficiency that is going to be needed in order to compensate for the loss of resources in the near future.
